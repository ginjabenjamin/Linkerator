# Linkerator
Air dirty laundry with the Linkerator!

Python script to scrape specified web page(s) for external links and verify whether or not it is an active resource.

This script was inspired by Shubham Shaw's article titled, High frequency security bug hunting: 120 days, 120 bugs (https://shubs.io/high-frequency-security-bug-hunting-120-days-120-bugs/) which talks about second order subdomain takeovers.

Defense: Validate external references/resources for potential exposures or an outdated attack surface
Offence: Identify resource that may be hijacked/zombified to launch remote code execution or client-based attacks
